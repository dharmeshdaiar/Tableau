# Tableau
## Introduction to Tableau

As part of this project, I have explored the basic functions of Tableau.

Using the EMSI_JobChange_UK dataset, I have created a dashboard.
- Using a bar chart, showing percentage change 
![ ](Tableau_Task_1)
- UK based map showing the key city locations impacted
![ ](Tableau_Task_2)

Using the **Extension_Task_SpotifyFeatures** dataset, I have conducted an analysis to find:
- Trends
- Key information
that could be used by an organisation for future projects.
